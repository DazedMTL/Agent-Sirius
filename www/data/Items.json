However, because the ego is being fortified,\ncontinuous exposure to pleasure can lead to an\naccelerated fall, making it a double-edged sword.\nDue to the enhancement of physical abilities, the\nsenses become hypersensitive, so the wearer needs\nto become somewhat accustomed to pleasure. By\nexperiencing all kinds of pleasure through lewd\ntraining and recording it in the Stand Alone\nProcess, resistance can be increased.> \n\n<SG説明3:The source of that power is the Hero Poison\n(Kuriyama Ikuto). Hanamura Sakiya (Hanasaku)\ncollects his semen, which amplifies and spreads\nheroic desires, and circulates it inside the suit.\nBecause of this, the wearer can draw out power\nequivalent to the Poison without becoming poisoned\nthemselves, but only during heroic activities. The\nlog equipped in the Solo Suit satisfies Ikuto's\ndesires when shown to him, becoming the vitality\nthat generates new power. And if the wearer\nawakens as a Poison, they can also control and use\nthat power to some extent.

The monster's body changes into\nsound itself, making it impossible to capture. It\nparasitizes various human audio works and uses\nhypnosis to manipulate those who listen to it at\nwill.

It can infiltrate anything,\nincluding TV, radio, and the internet. It can\nbrainwash and imprint subconsciously. If the\nperson vocalizes it, hypnosis is possible through\ntext or video as well. It can also lurk in short\nsounds like chimes or ring tones. The weakness is\nthat it cannot directly interfere, so its\ninfluence may be overpowered by other pleasure-\nbased brainwashing methods.>\n\n<SG説明4:>\n<SGピクチャ4:ヒプノボイス> ",
